# My_RPG

This project is one of the freest project of your first year. Create your own RPG.
Your main challenge for this game will be to create a complete product using everything that you and your
team know.

## Description :

Your game must follow the following rules:\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• The player needs to have characteristics which you can find in the status menu.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• The player can fight enemies, statistics will impact the fights results.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• There must be NPC in your game.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• You need to implement at least one quest.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• The player must have an inventory which can contain a limited set of items.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• The player can earn experience by winning fights and accomplishing specific actions.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• With enough experience, the player can level up, upgrading its statistics.

To realize our project, we were only allowed to use some functions,\
most of them being forbidden such as: printf

    <br/>
  <img src="./img/authorized_function.png" />
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p>

Now that you know everything, it's time to explain how to play the game.
